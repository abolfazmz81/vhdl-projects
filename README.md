# VHDL-projects

Series of vhdl projects for learning VHDl Language

## Description

This repository contains series of different `VHDL` modules that were created for learning porpuses in `Computer-Aided Design Systems (CADS)` Course in `Noshirvani University of Technology`.

This modules and projects were developed and tested using `Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7` on `Windows XP`.
